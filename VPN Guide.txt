What is a VPN?
A Virtual Private Network (VPN) creates a secure and encrypted tunnel between your device and the internet. This protects your data from prying eyes, hackers, and internet service providers.

WireGuard: Modern, extremely fast, and secure.
IKEv2: Ideal for mobile users because of its reliability on unstable connections.
Performance Factors:

Server distance affects speed
Encryption overhead can influence performance
Network congestion may cause slowdowns
Privacy Policies:

How Do VPNs Work?
Encryption Process: Your data is encrypted locally (using protocols like OpenVPN or WireGuard) before being sent.
Tunneling: Data travels through a secure, private tunnel between your device and the VPN server.
IP Masking: Your real IP address is replaced by the VPN server’s IP, protecting your location and identity online.
Pro Tip
Choose the best VPN based on your specific needs—some are optimized for streaming, others for maximum security. Always verify features and performance within the provider’s money-back guarantee period.
