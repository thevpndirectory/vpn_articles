## What is a VPN?

A **VPN** (Virtual Private Network) encrypts your internet connection and routes your traffic through a secure server, masking your IP address and shielding your data from hackers, advertisers, and even your ISP. This encrypted tunnel means your personal information and browsing activity remain private, even on unsecured Wi-Fi networks.

Whether you want to secure your sensitive data, stream content from other countries, or simply browse anonymously, a VPN is an essential tool. For VPN comparisons and tutorials, visit [thevpndirectory.com](https://www.thevpndirectory.com).
